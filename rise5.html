										<h1>Fictional Characters and the Portrayal of Female Suicide</h1>
									</header>

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/pict.jpg" alt="" /></span>

									<p>“It is important to note that suicide, in its literary representations, is an act that areas the invisibility of women and in particular their death, by forcing women onto the public stage in the role of dramatic heroines.” (Zamperini 83)</p>

	<p>While through the lens of many, the high rates of female suicide were related almost entirely to the social pressures of chastity and honor, there are other perspectives given in the role of female heroines in literature of the time. In Zamperini’s article, she discusses female suicide as an act of independence, passion, and reassertion in the literary representations of women during the Ming to Qing period. Neoconfucian influence led to changes in the perspectives of marriage and chastity, but in literature, fiction heroines “can use suicide as a vehicle to convey to enternity the strength of their passions, from love to hatred, from jealousy to thirst for vegenance” (Zamperini 78). In many stories during the Ming period, female suicide is portrayed as an act of strength or morality, yet there are still some that act in recognition of the importance of chastity.
</p>
									<p>In Rulin Waishi, a 1750 novel, a young widow starves herself to death to follow her husband to the grave. Her father praises her, “She died well! She died well!”, as dying for the noblest of reasons. He was able to detach himself from personal attachments and view her death as purely following the Confucian values. Her father mentions he is almost jealous of her death.
</p>
<p>In the Feng Menglong story, Jin Yunu Beats the Heartless Man, the small story at the beginning describes a poor couple living off the husband's wage selling firewood. The husband is ridiculed by children as he walks past with the wood and the wife is humiliated. She wishes for a better life, but he begs her to stay because he is studying to be an official and believes the prosperous times are ahead. The wife is stubborn as asks to leave him, the husband finally gives in. A few years later, the husband becomes a prefect and the wife is so ashamed to have abandoned him and not seen his potential. In humiliation, she throws herself into the river and drowns. In this story, the wife commits suicide out of shame of her actions as she was not faithful and loyal to her husband. The story does not directly address chastity, but loyalty to one’s husband is still seen as the only honorable way of life.
</p>
<p>More in line with Zamperini’s article is the story also by Feng Menglong, Du Shiniang Sinks Her Jewel Box. After discovering that her faithless lover seeks to sell her to a greedy merchant he met, Du Shiniang shows the two men the great financial treasure she holds in her jewel box before pouring it into the oceans. After this gesture, she drowns herself with the box and has proven her financial and moral worth (Zamperini 89). Du Shiniang did not commit suicide in the name of chastity, but rather as an act of passion and freewill. Other female heroines followed similar storylines in literature during this time.
</p>
<p>Although the reality of the times did involve great pressure from society on women to remain chaste and adhere to confucian values, some literature took a different stance and framed suicide as a method of freeing women from their oppression.
